# 📘 Commit and Branch Conventions

At `wapi.go`, we follow a strict set of conventions for commit messages and branch names to ensure that our repository stays organized, and our commit history remains crystal clear. Here's a guide on our conventions:

---

## 🚀 Conventional Commits

Conventional commits ensure our commit messages are clear and useful.

📋 **Benefits**:

- 📜 Automatic changelog generation
- 🔢 Simplified versioning
- 🧐 Improved readability of commit messages

### 📄 Commit Message Format

Each commit message should follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<optional body>
<BLANK LINE>
<optional footer>
```

- **`<type>`**: Describes the purpose of the commit:
  - 🆕 `feat`: Introduces a new feature
  - 🐞 `fix`: Addresses a bug
  - 📚 `docs`: Updates documentation
  - 🎨 `style`: Code that relates to styling, not affecting logic
  - 🔧 `refactor`: Refactoring existing code
  - 🚀 `perf`: Improving performance
  - 🧪 `test`: All about tests
  - 🧽 `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- **`<scope>`**: (Optional) Specifies which part of the codebase is affected.

- **`<short summary>`**: A concise summary of the changes made.

### 📝 Examples:

1. Introducing a new feature:

```
feat(auth): implement social login
```

2. Addressing a bug:

```
fix(button): resolve alignment issue
```

## 🌲 Conventional Branching

A standardized naming system for branches helps everyone quickly understand a branch's purpose.

### 📄 Branch Naming Format

Branch names should adhere to:

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

- **`<type>`**: Purpose of the branch, common ones being:

  - 🆕 `feature`: Developing a new feature.
  - 🐞 `fix`: Addressing a bug.
  - 🧽 `chore`: Regular maintenance tasks.
  - 🔥 `hotfix`: Immediate fixes, often tied to production issues.
  - 📚 `docs`: Documentation enhancements.

- **`<short-description>`**: A brief, kebab-cased (words separated by hyphens) description of the branch's objective.

### 📝 Examples:

1. Developing a new user dashboard:

```
feature/user-dashboard
```

2. Resolving a login issue:

```
fix/login-issue
```
