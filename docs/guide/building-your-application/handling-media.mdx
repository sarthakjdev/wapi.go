Officially Whatsapp supports uploading of media via API, getting Media Url from media Id and deleting the media. But the SDK as of now only supports the two features: 

- [Getting media Url from media Id](#getting-media-url-from-media-id)
- [Deleting the media](#deleting-media)


## Getting media Url from media Id

You can get the media Url from media Id using the `getMediaUrl` method available on the [client](api-reference/classes/Client) class media manager. Here is an example of how you can get the media Url:

```typescript
	await whatsappClient.media.getUrl('mediaId')
```


## Deleting media

You can delete a media using the `deleteMedia` method available on the [client](api-reference/classes/Client) class media manager. Here is an example of how you can delete the media:

```typescript
	await whatsappClient.media.delete('mediaId')
```
