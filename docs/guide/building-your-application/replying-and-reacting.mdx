## Replying to Messages

You can reply to a messsage via event listerner handler. 

```typescript

// assuming you already have initiated the client,
// you can do the following to reply to incoming messages


// in the similar way, any incoming message event, 
// which is not a System event can be replied back to.
```


## Reacting to Messages

There are mainly two ways you can react to a message:

### Via Incoming Message Event

You can listen to incoming messages and reply to them using the `on` method available on the [client](api-reference/classes/Client) event. Here is an example of how you can listen to incoming messages and react to them:

```typescript

// assuming you already have initiated the client,
// you can do the following to reply to incoming messages


// in the similar way, any incoming message event, 
// which is not a System event can be replied back to.
```


### Via Sending a Reaction message

You can also send a message of type  `Reaction` to a message. Here is an example of how you can send a reaction a message:

```typescript

// assuming you already have initiated the client,

const replyMessageComponent = new ReplyMessage({
    message: new TextMessage({
        text: 'This is a reply.'
    })
})

// send a reaction message
await whatsappClient.message.send({
    message: replyMessageComponent,
    phoneNumber: '1234567890',
})

```
