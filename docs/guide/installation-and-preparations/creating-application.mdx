## Initiating a Wapi.go project

### Chat bot

The first step to build a Wapi.go based chat bot is to create a new project. You can do this by running the following command:

```go
go mod init <project-name>
go get github.com/sarthakjdev/wapi.go
```

### Other use cases

- You are a developer and want to integrate the whatsapp business API with your existing backend.
- You are a solution partner or a tech partner with WhatsApp and want to access the WhatsApp business API to build a solution for your clients.
