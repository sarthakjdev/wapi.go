To receive messages from your customers, you need to configure a webhook for your Whatsapp Business Account. The webhook is a URL that you provide to Whatsapp to send messages to your application.


## Configuring Webhook for local development setup


### Getting a public URL for your local development setup

<Note>You may sometimes face an error on the whatsapp webhook management dashboard saying that the URL is malicious in case when you are using NGROK, in that case you must go ahead with using cloudflare tunnel.</Note>

- [Using NGROK](#ngrok)
- [Using Cloudflare Tunnel](#cloudflare-tunnel)


#### NGROK

If you are developing your application locally, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet.

To use ngrok, follow these steps:

1. Download and install ngrok from [here](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. Run the following command in your terminal to expose your local server to the internet:

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:<your-application-port>
```
3. You will see something like this in your terminal:
  <Frame>
    <img src="/assets/configure-webhook/1.png" />
  </Frame>

<Note>Make sure to replace `<your-application-port>` with the port number on which your application is running.</Note>


####  Cloudflare Tunnel

To use cloudflare tunnel, follow these steps:

1. Download and install cloudflare tunnel from [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation).
2. Run the following command in your terminal to expose your local server to the internet:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<your-application-port>
```

3. You will see something like this in your terminal:
  <Frame>
    <img src="/assets/configure-webhook/cloudlfare.png" />
  </Frame>

<Note>Make sure to replace `<your-application-port>` with the port number on which your application is running.</Note>
