## About

Wapi.go is a Golang SDK, that supports WhatsApp API products i.e., Business Management API and Cloud API
to build WhatsApp applications easily.
This SDK supports managing WhatsApp business accounts, and managing phone numbers for a WhatsApp business account which includes creating, verifying, and registering a phone number to use for messaging via cloud API and deregistering a phone number. This SDK also supports the management of message templates which includes creating new templates or updating/deleting the existing ones.

You can listen to the incoming webhook events via the inbuilt standalone HTTP server built using echo and also you can integrate the SDK within your existing backend applications using the getters for the route handlers of the webhook server.

## Features
